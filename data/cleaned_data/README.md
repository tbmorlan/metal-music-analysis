# Data Cleaning Notes

- Added genre column to each dataset
    - "thrash_and_speed_metal.csv" was shortened to thrash metal due to the terms being used interchangeably
- Append datasets with short python script
- Remove random data in columns that shouldn't be there (char in numeric columns)
- Remove all null values (cannot perform analysis with null due to every value in table needed)
